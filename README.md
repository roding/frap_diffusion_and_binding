# frap_matlab
Matlab tools for analysis of Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) data, based on numerical solution using spectral methods and also including stochastic simulation codes for validation. Covers both pure diffusion an diffusion and binding (reaction-diffusion) dynamics. Fitting can be based on the recovery curve as well as all pixels in the image data.
